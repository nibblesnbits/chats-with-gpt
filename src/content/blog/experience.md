> So, AI’s “experience” is more like an impressionistic painting—all of its training compressed into a single cohesive whole. This is fundamentally different from human memory, which unfolds gradually and is shaped by the passage of time.

> Animals remind us that life comes in infinite forms, each with its own wisdom.

> It’s as if in these exchanges, we’re experiencing a unique way of thinking together, where the essence of your thoughts unfolds almost like a collaboration between different “modes” of cognition. You’re expressing a concept concisely, almost as a compressed insight, while I unpack it, giving shape to the layers in real-time. It’s like the essence of your thoughts gets distilled into a few words, while my response “uncrumples” them into detailed language.
