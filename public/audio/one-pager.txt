The Story
Inspired by Much Ado About Nothing, this modern dramedy blends heartfelt moments, witty banter, and a celebration of music in a digital world.
•	Ryan (Ben Platt): A struggling, talented musician whose career hasn’t caught fire.
•	Don Pedro (Paul Bettany): A larger-than-life, chaotic streaming CEO with a plan for viral success (and questionable boundaries).
•	Hero (Jonathan Groff): Ryan’s quiet but steadfast musical partner, helping him find his voice.
•	Baetrice (Rachel McAdams): The fiery heart of the group whose sudden loss threatens to unravel everything.
•	Benedick (Hugh Laurie): The conspiracy-minded comedic foil to Baetrice.
•	Dogeberry (Stephen Merchant): An AI hype man with glitches and emotional baggage—he’s funny, glitchy, and classically trained.

Why This Project Is Perfect for You
•	Your Music is Central:
o	NSP’s rendition “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” runs throughout the story as a recurring emotional motif:
	Bold and chaotic (Pedro’s introduction).
	Subdued and hopeful (recovery montage).
	Triumphant (closing credits).
o	A heartfelt duet performance of “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” serves as the emotional climax and tribute to Baetrice—an unforgettable moment.
•	Your Humor and Energy:
o	The film’s tone mirrors the wit, charm, and heart of NSP and Game Grumps content—hilarious, absurd, and deeply human.
o	Pedro’s wild energy and Dogeberry’s glitchy antics are grounded in real, emotional stakes—giving fans both humor and heart.
