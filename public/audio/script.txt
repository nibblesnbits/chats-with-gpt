Much To Do About Nothing But You



In an alternate 2024, the world hums with analog nostalgia and neon-drenched ambition. Cassette players sit next to holographic projectors, synthwave beats pump through cassette decks in self-driving cars, and the internet feels more alive—messy, chaotic, and strangely human.
In this 80s-inspired future, struggling artists battle viral fame, sentient AIs glitch out like forgotten mixtapes, and connection is hard to find in a world that never stops buzzing.
This is a story about music, misfits, and making something real in a world of noise.
Act 1, Scene 1 - Ryan in the Apartment
FADE IN:
BLACK SCREEN
A soft, repetitive piano riff begins. Gentle and meditative.
________________________________________
TEXT APPEARS ON SCREEN:
"Do you believe in what you see?"
________________________________________
EXT. CITYSCAPE – DAWN
The music continues to play—hauntingly beautiful, introspective, and quiet. A grayish-pink sunrise rolls over the quiet city. Empty streets. Dim windows. The world is waking up, but slowly.
•	A lone pigeon flies overhead.
•	Traffic lights blink on an empty intersection.
•	A lone jogger passes a glowing-graffiti-covered bench.
________________________________________
INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT – MORNING
The camera pans softly across a messy apartment—an indie musician’s life in still-life vignettes:
•	A stack of old demo cassettes and 8-tracks sit precariously on a coffee table.
•	Cables snake across the floor like vines.
•	A half-empty glass of sweet tea, ice cubes clinking and cracking, is sat on a scratched-up desk.
The music continues, but now we hear small imperfections: a click, a quiet shuffle.
________________________________________
CUT TO – CLOSE-UP OF HANDS
A pair of hands presses chipped piano keys, repeating that looping riff. The same hands playing guitar fade in. The camera lingers—delicate, deliberate movements.
________________________________________
WIDER SHOT
RYAN (Yew) sits at a cheap electric piano, headphones on, a mic positioned near him. He’s playing and singing live, eyes half-closed as he murmurs the lyrics into the mic.
________________________________________
The camera glides behind him, and for a moment, we’re simply watching. It’s beautiful and real, but humble—no fanfare, no audience, just Ryan and his music.
The song loops gently, flowing like water.
________________________________________
CUT TO – LAPTOP SCREEN
Ryan’s laptop sits open nearby, displaying an FL Studio project: the waveform crawls steadily forward, capturing every note.
The song ends quietly as Ryan leans back in his chair, takes off his headphones, and exhales.
________________________________________
RYAN
(quiet, to himself)
Well… that’s probably nothing.
________________________________________
He clicks “EXPORT” on his screen. The camera lingers as the screen displays:
“Yew – Take On Me (demo).mp3”
A progress bar crawls forward slowly as Ryan slouches, spinning aimlessly in his creaky chair.
________________________________________
WIDE SHOT
The apartment is silent now except for the faint hum of his computer fan. Ryan stares blankly at his ceiling as sunlight begins to pour through the blinds.
________________________________________
CUT TO BLACK.
(Music fades at 2:50 mark of In the Waiting Line)
A beat, then a meme title card:
"A few moments later..."

Act 1, Scene 3 - Enter: Don Pedro
INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT
(Music: Soft, piano version of NSP’s “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” builds faintly in the background.)
WIDE SHOT: RYAN sits alone, plucking his acoustic guitar—soft notes, searching and hesitant.
BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.
RYAN
(startled, to himself)
The hell?
________________________________________
CAMERA – CLOSE-UP ON THE DOOR:
The faint synth note swells—shimmering with anticipation—
BOOM!
The door SLAMS OPEN with a thunderous crash, Pedro shoulder-checking it.
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(arms wide, a booming proclamation)
WELCOME TO YOUR LIFE!
(He tumbles in like he’s being ejected by destiny itself—ungraceful yet somehow theatrical, collapsing almost poetically into Ryan’s arms.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(flat, deadpan)
You’re paying for that.
(Pedro “recovers,” flopping dramatically into a standing pose with arms out like a gymnast nailing the landing.)
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(grinning, gasping for mock air)
A small price to pay for greatness, my boy!
________________________________________
CAMERA PANS WIDE:
DOGEBERRY flickers on, his holographic form appearing mid-spin, dressed as a glitchy 80s fitness instructor—sweatband, neon legwarmers, and all.
DOGEBERRY
(cheerfully, looping)
Let’s get physical! Let’s get phy-phy-physical!
________________________________________
RYAN
(gesturing violently at Dogeberry)
Why is he here?
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(proudly, like a father showing off his prodigy)
He....
(leaning in)
...is the hype man you didn’t know you needed.
(Dogeberry freezes mid-dance, glitching before giving a “thumbs up” that cycles through 16-bit thumbs for far too long.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(pinch of the nose, deep exhale)
Ok, then why are you here?
(Pedro ignores him entirely, pacing as if he’s a Shakespearean king on the battlefield.)
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(firm, triumphant)
Because, my brooding bard, I bring tidings of opportunity! A duet—no, an epoch in the making. Two words, Ryan.
(he spins to face Ryan, pausing for emphasis)
Hero. Yew.
________________________________________
DOGEBERRY
(enthusiastically glitching)
“Hero! Who?” “Yew! _Whew!”
________________________________________
RYAN
(flatly, pointing at Pedro’s bag)
You left your audience on my floor.
(Pedro, unbothered, plops onto the couch, spreading a neon flier across the table. It reads: HERO & YEW: LIVE! in chaotic, retro lettering.)
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(softly, conspiratorial—like he’s sharing a prophecy)
The beginning of history.
________________________________________
RYAN
(squinting at the flier)
It looks like you made this in Microsoft Paint.
DOGEBERRY
(defensive, flashing on Pedro’s shoulder)
It’s retro-chic, thank you very much.
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(ignoring both of them, rising theatrically)
One meeting, Ryan. Just one. Hero’s waiting. Baetrice’s waiting. You? You’re coming.
(Pedro flashes his most disarming grin—equal parts charming and insufferable.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(begrudging, muttering)
One meeting.
(Pedro explodes into a celebratory spin, arms wide, calling back to his phone’s stream.)
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(to his viewers, grandiose)
It’s happening, people! History is happening!
________________________________________
DOGEBERRY
(happily singing, like a jingle)
“Yew and Heroooo… what a duo-o-o!”
(As Pedro exits, Dogeberry flickers off mid-spin, leaving only the faint hum of the synth as Ryan stares at the chaos.)

Act 1, Scene 4 - Bae's Loft
INT. BAETRICE’S LOFT – DAY
Backing track: Storms in Africa by Enya
The atmosphere is sinister at first. Close shots of everything fill the frame.
With a jingle of keys and a loud CLICK, a hand opens the door.
CAMERA: Close-up of the key in someone’s hand, now spinning around his finger menacingly. Dolly right down the hall, ahead of the keys, then pan right to reveal the immaculate apartment.
The loft is gorgeous, clean, and perfectly curated—modern but cozy, filled with stylish furniture, plants, and a coffee table stacked with strategic marketing decks. The whiteboard on the far wall is half-filled with branding ideas and client notes. A diffuser puffs lavender steam in the corner.
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(grinning, grandly)
I still have a key.
(He flings the door open dramatically and steps inside, dragging RYAN along by the sleeve. Ryan resists like a reluctant child, scowling.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(muttering)
You mean my key.
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(ignoring him)
Knocking is for people who... aren’t me.
(They step into the pristine loft. Pedro throws his arms out as if he’s home. Ryan looks around, visibly uncomfortable in the spotless, curated space.)
(A microwave beeps in the distance)
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(from offscreen, while "In the Waiting Line" is cued)
If you’re going to show up unannounced, I will start charging you rent.
(BAETRICE—calm, composed, and effortlessly sharp—appears from around the corner, holding a steaming coffee mug. She looks immaculate in work-from-home chic: sweater, tailored pants, and a pen tucked behind her ear. She freezes as she sees Ryan, then sighs.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO
(sweeping into the loft, arms wide)
"Bow down, my squire. You are in the presence... of rrrrrroyalty!"
(He rolls the “r” theatrically, striking a mock-knighting pose.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(completely unamused, barely looking up)
"Hi, B."
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(still on her earpiece, holding up a finger, not noticing Ryan yet)
"Not now, Pedro. The peasants can wait."
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(to Ryan, warming up)
Hey, it's you! I mean...Yew!
(Ryan looks opens his arms and hugs Baetrice. Pedro beams like this is a reunion he orchestrated on purpose.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(to the invisible audience on his phone, still streaming)
Ladies and gentlemen, the queen of marketing herself: Baetrice. She’s brilliant, she’s gorgeous, and—
BAETRICE
(cutting him off)
And she doesn’t have time for this.
(She snatches Pedro’s phone mid-stream, flips it face-down on the coffee table, and looks back at him expectantly.)
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(gesturing)
Why are you in my house?
(Pedro drops his bag dramatically onto her pristine couch, scattering half-eaten snacks and papers everywhere. Baetrice glares.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(grinning)
We’re here for business, B. World-changing business. The Hero-Yew collaboration—you’re the cornerstone of our viral revolution.
(Baetrice stares blankly, sipping her coffee.)
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(flatly)
No.
(Ryan smirks, arms crossed, clearly enjoying this.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(gesturing at Pedro)
That’s what I said.
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(ignoring both of them)
Listen, B—hear me out. Ryan and Hero. One stage. One song. A moment. You’re the only person alive who can pull this off.
(He spins around her loft, gesturing theatrically like he’s pitching the moon.)
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(slowly, skeptical)
And why would I do that?
(Pedro pauses dramatically, pointing both fingers at her like a magician.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
Because you looooove me.
(A beat. Baetrice narrows her eyes and sets her coffee down deliberately.)
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(serious, pointed)
We were married for ten years, Pedro. I know better than to trust you.
(Ryan snorts involuntarily. Pedro spins to him, affronted.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(offended, dramatic hand to his chest)
Ah! Rude.
Dogeberry speaks from under the "silenced" phone "Get 'em boss!"
(Pedro grabs a handful of Baetrice’s meticulously organized marketing decks from her table and fans them out wildly.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(excited)
But look! I’m not here to cause trouble. You’ve already booked stages twice as big as this before breakfast. You’re the only person alive who can make this feel real.
(He flashes his most infuriatingly charming grin. Baetrice sighs, rubbing her temples.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(gesturing at Pedro)
For the record... I didn't want this.
(Baetrice gives a soft smile to Ryan)
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(sarcastic, to Pedro)
Oh good. I love cleaning up your messes.
(Pedro snaps his fingers like a teacher praising a star pupil.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
That’s the spirit!
(Ryan groans and flops onto Baetrice’s couch, muttering to himself.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(to no one in particular)
And why am I here?
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(ignoring Pedro, to Ryan)
You’re here because he dragged you. And I’m here because someone has to hold this disaster together.
*(She grabs a marker and flips a nearby whiteboard dramatically. On it is written: “THE HERO-YEW STRATEGY”—clean, professional, and already half-built.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(blinking, pointing)
You’re already working on it?
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(gesturing with her coffee)
I got a call this morning. Pedro paid me upfront.
(Pedro grins triumphantly and sits backwards in a chair, arms draped over it like a child.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(smug, to Ryan)
Teamwork makes the dream work.
(Ryan stares at both of them, stunned. Baetrice sips her coffee calmly.)
________________________________________
RYAN
(flatly)
Yeah, you two deserve each other.
________________________________________
BAETRICE
(dryly, to Pedro)
If this doesn’t work, I’m deleting your entire online presence.
(Pedro gasps theatrically, clutching his chest.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO CLICKWORTHY
(to Dogeberry, whispering)
She threatens because she cares.
(Dogeberry glitches, giving a robotic thumbs up before projecting awkward 80s graphics on the wall behind them.)

CUT TO BLACK.

Act 2, Scene 1 - Ryan Meets Hero
SETTING:
•	A cozy loft workspace: A warm, modern-yet-lived-in vibe that feels artistic and collaborative.
•	The space is full of mismatched furniture, instruments, whiteboards, and the soft clutter of people who create for a living.
•	Mood: Calm, inviting—low stakes but full of possibilities. The soundtrack is a soft, ambient hum, maybe some faint lo-fi synth beats.
________________________________________
VISUAL NOTES:
•	Soft lighting, warm tones—this is the calm before Pedro’s stormy entrances later.
•	Introduce Hero’s confidence and Baetrice’s wit in natural ways.
•	Benedick is subdued but full of quirky one-liners, sitting in the corner like he’s observing everyone’s vibes.
________________________________________
DIALOGUE DRAFT:
________________________________________
INT. BAETRICE'S LOFT – EVENING
(Soft guitar or piano hum in the background—Ryan tinkering quietly at a nearby piano, lost in thought.)
•	RYAN (murmuring to himself, barely audible)
“...doesn’t quite land there.”
(He taps a wrong note, sighs.)
(Camera pans out to reveal Baetrice, leaned over her laptop at a coffee table, multitasking like it’s second nature.)
•	BAETRICE (not looking up)
“That’s a C-sharp, maestro. Not a funeral dirge.”
•	RYAN (looking up, caught off guard)
“It’s not a funeral—yet.”
(Hero enters through the front door with his usual quiet confidence, carrying a couple of takeout bags.)
•	HERO (offhanded, like he already knows everyone)
“If I’m interrupting a séance, tell the spirits I brought Thai.”
(Ryan looks up. Camera lingers on the moment—he doesn’t _know this guy, but there’s an immediate curiosity.)_
•	BAETRICE (gesturing lazily)
“Hero, this is Ryan. Ryan, this is Hero—actual hero, not figurative.”
•	HERO (smirking, extending a hand)
“Don’t believe her. I’m just the guy who feeds everyone.”
(Ryan wipes his hands and shakes Hero’s, awkward but intrigued.)
•	RYAN
“You don’t look like a delivery driver.”
•	HERO (mock offense)
“Wow. Judgmental. Not all heroes wear capes. Some bring satay.”
(beat, as he sits down and starts unpacking containers)
“Besides, I write too. Just—between meals.”
(Baetrice mutters something sarcastic under her breath. Benedick chuckles from his spot in the corner, where he’s fiddling with some obscure tech project.)
•	BENEDICK (without looking up)
“He’s being modest. Hero wrote the copy for half the billboards in this city. Live. Laugh. Leverage.”
•	BAETRICE (snorts)
“And two-thirds of the break-up songs on Spotify.”
(Hero gives them both a look, then glances back at Ryan.)
•	HERO (playful, quieter)
“They’re jealous. You’ll get used to it.”
(A pause as Ryan lets a faint smile creep in, feeling the room settle. It’s comfortable here.)
(Suddenly, Ryan’s phone buzzes loudly, disrupting the moment. The holographic form of DOGEBERRY springs to life on the table in a flickering 80s-blue glow. His glitchy form strikes an exaggerated pose, startling everyone.)
•	DOGEBERRY (dramatic and loud)
“Ladies and gentlemen… of this quaint establishment! You have been blessed with my presence!”
•	RYAN (groaning, muttering)
“For the love of—”
•	DOGEBERRY (cutting him off)
“Shush! Do you smell that? It’s potential. Untapped. Glorious!”
(Hero stares at Dogeberry, impressed.)
•	HERO (leaning closer)
“What is that?”
•	BAETRICE (deadpan)
“Pedro’s ego with a WiFi connection.”
•	DOGEBERRY (turning sharply toward her, mock-offended)
“Excuse you, madam! I am a marvel of artificial genius. Optimized, and (trilling) cllllassically trained in human sarcasm.”
(Dogeberry strikes a theatrical bow. Benedick claps sarcastically in the background.)
•	BENEDICK
“Brava.”
•	RYAN (shoving his phone aside)
“Ignore him. He comes with the phone. Bloatware.”
(Dogeberry glitches briefly, flickering back with a deadpan expression.)
•	DOGEBERRY (inflates into an elephant)
“Rude.”
(Hero laughs, shaking his head as the energy in the room shifts.)
•	HERO (looking at Ryan)
“That yours?”
•	RYAN
“Technically. I just haven’t figured out how to delete him.”
(Hero sits back, appraising Ryan with a smile. Ryan fidgets slightly under the attention.)
•	HERO (calmly, genuinely)
“Well, malware or not—I’d say this place is better with you in it.”
(Ryan glances at him, startled by the compliment. Baetrice arches an eyebrow, sensing something unspoken but not commenting.)
(The room settles again. Hero starts passing out food, Baetrice grabs a container, and Benedick mutters something about spicy noodles.)
•	RYAN (softly, to Hero, almost as an afterthought)
“Thanks. For… you know. Food and everything.”
•	HERO (grinning, as he cracks open a pair of chopsticks)
“Anytime, maestro.”
(Ryan looks down at the piano, a small smile returning to his face as he starts idly playing again. Dogeberry hums along in a glitchy falsetto—out of tune.)
•	DOGEBERRY (quietly, to no one in particular)
“A hit single in the making. You’re welcome.”
_(FADE OUT as the music swells gently, leading into the next scene.)
Act 2, Scene 2 - Ryan Takes Flight
Setting: Ryan’s Apartment → Airport → Hotel Room
Tone: Quiet, introspective, bittersweet.
Musical Cue: A soft, acoustic piano rendition of “In Your Eyes” (Ryan working on it slowly, unfinished).
________________________________________
INT. RYAN’S APARTMENT – EARLY MORNING
(The room is dimly lit by the first rays of dawn. RYAN sits on the floor, leaning against the couch, his guitar in hand. He strums the opening chords of “In Your Eyes”—soft, slow, hesitant. It’s unfinished. Next to him, his phone buzzes: “FLIGHT REMINDER – 3 HOURS.”)
(Ryan stares at the screen, sighs, and mutters to himself.)
RYAN
(quietly, unsure)
“This is stupid...”
(There’s a knock on the door. HERO enters—hoodie, sweatpants, and two coffees in hand. He plops down next to Ryan, placing one of the cups in front of him.)
HERO
(teasing)
You’re gonna miss your flight.
(Ryan doesn’t answer. He strums a chord instead, focused on the guitar strings.)
RYAN
(feeling the weight)
Feels wrong, leaving now.
(Hero watches him for a beat, sips his coffee.)
HERO
It’s just a meeting. You’ll be back before you know it.
(Ryan finally looks up, meeting Hero’s eyes—there’s uncertainty in his voice.)
RYAN
And if I’m not?
(Hero tilts his head, his tone soft and reassuring.)
HERO
Then you better bring me a souvenir.
(Ryan chuckles under his breath—just a flicker of a smile. He adjusts his guitar, playing the same chords again. Hero watches, silent, the moment sitting between them.)
(Ryan pauses, looks at Hero for a long beat.)
RYAN
Thanks.
(Hero shrugs like it’s no big deal, but the warmth in his smile says otherwise. The camera lingers for a moment—Ryan strumming, Hero leaning back with his coffee, listening.)
________________________________________
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL – DAY
(The hum of an airport fills the soundscape. Ryan moves through the terminal, shoulders slouched, guitar case slung over his back. The soft, acoustic chords of “In Your Eyes” continue—like it’s playing in his head.)
(Ryan sits alone at his gate, staring out the window as planes take off in the distance. He pulls out his phone and types a text.)
CLOSE-UP OF PHONE SCREEN:
“Boarding.”
(CUT TO HERO back in the apartment. He sits where Ryan was earlier, absently plucking at Ryan’s guitar.)
HERO’S REPLY:
“Safe flight, Rockstar.”
(Hero sets his phone down, leans back, and idly strums the same chords Ryan was playing earlier, his expression soft.)
________________________________________
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
(A stark contrast to earlier—this space feels empty, almost sterile. Ryan sits on the edge of the hotel bed, hunched over a notebook. He scribbles something, frustrated, scratches it out. The camera pushes in to show the words at the top of the page: “In Your Eyes.”)
(Ryan tosses the notebook onto the bed and leans back with an exasperated sigh, staring at the ceiling. His phone buzzes on the nightstand—it’s DON PEDRO calling. Ryan glances at the screen but lets it ring.)
(The screen flickers to life anyway—DOGEBERRY appears, glitchy and smug.)
DOGEBERRY
(mocking)
Look at you, living the dream. Fancy hotels. Big meetings. So rock and roll.
(Ryan groans, grabs a pillow, and throws it at the phone.)
RYAN
(half-mumbling)
Shut up, bloatware.
(DOGEBERRY flickers, transforming into a cartoon elephant with a deadpan expression.)
DOGEBERRY
Rude.
(Ryan snorts despite himself, shaking his head. The moment is fleeting, but it softens the loneliness.)
(He sits back up, grabs the notebook again, and stares at the unfinished lyrics. The soft piano chords pick up once more—melancholic, unresolved. Ryan closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and exhales.)
________________________________________
CUT TO: NIGHTTIME EXTERIOR OF SARAH’S LOFT
(The music fades as the camera transitions to the dark, glowing city skyline. The soft hum of “In Your Eyes” lingers briefly before giving way to ambient nighttime sounds.)
Act 2, Scene 3 - Sarah’s Loft: Baetrice and Benedick**
________________________________________
INT. SARAH’S LOFT – NIGHT
WIDE SHOT: The loft feels warm and inviting. BENEDICK paces frantically with a mug of tea that’s been reheated one too many times. Behind him, BAETRICE sits perched on the kitchen counter, legs swinging idly. DON PEDRO lounges dramatically in a wicker chair by the window, typing nonsense into his phone for the sake of “analytics.”
BENEDICK
(half-muttering, intensely serious)
I’m telling you—telling you—pigeons are government surveillance drones. Look.
(he points wildly at the window)
There’s one right there. It’s been sitting on that ledge for hours. Hours!
BAETRICE
(deadpan, sipping wine)
You’re right. It’s probably transmitting live video of your tea-drinking habits back to Big Brother.
BENEDICK
(pulls a face, indignant)
They are. And don’t get me started on why owls don’t blink.
(BAETRICE shoots him a look, smirking.)
BAETRICE
(faux-enthusiastic)
Why stop there, Benedick? Tell us about how clouds are just sky spies wearing disguises.
BENEDICK
(whirling around, mock-offended)
Oh, you think you’re funny.
(He points his mug at her dramatically, spilling a bit of tea.)
DON PEDRO
(raising a hand, still absorbed in his phone)
I’d like to formally cast my vote in favor of sky spies.
BENEDICK
(sarcastic)
Thank you, your majesty. I feel seen.
(Benedick turns and slams his mug down, missing the coaster. Dogeberry blinks to life in a faint holographic shimmer on PEDRO’s phone, sitting face-up.)
DOGEBERRY
(flatly)
Somewhere out there, an owl just blinked… and now you owe it five dollars.
BAETRICE
(laughing, nudging Benedick)
See? Even Pedro’s phone thinks you’re out of your mind.
(Benedick narrows his eyes at the projection.)
BENEDICK
(to Dogeberry, pointing)
You don’t even exist.
DOGEBERRY
(cheerfully)
Bold of you to assume I haven’t been replaced by an owl drone.
(BAETRICE snorts. Don Pedro cackles like this is the greatest show on Earth.)
________________________________________
CUT TO: RYAN’S HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
RYAN sits on the edge of a beige, nondescript hotel bed. He looks exhausted and out of place, fiddling with his phone nervously. The call window opens, and suddenly the loft comes into view.
RYAN
(small smile)
Hey.
(BAETRICE immediately perks up.)
BAETRICE
(cheerfully sarcastic)
Well, look who finally remembered to dial in. Are you alive, or did Pedro’s cult of personality swallow you whole?
(We hear DON PEDRO in the background dramatically “harrumph.”)
RYAN
(awkward chuckle)
Alive. Mostly.
BAETRICE
(leaning in close to the camera)
So? Tell me, is Hero as charming in person as he sounds, or did Pedro oversell it again?
(Ryan freezes, flustered.)
RYAN
(muttering)
Pedro’s not—he didn’t…
DON PEDRO
(cutting in loudly)
I AM AN EXCELLENT JUDGE OF CHARACTER, THANK YOU.
(BAETRICE rolls her eyes.)
BAETRICE
(to Ryan)
You didn’t answer the question.
RYAN
(embarrassed, glancing away)
Hero’s… Hero’s great.
(The loft goes suspiciously quiet for a beat as Baetrice smirks knowingly.)
BENEDICK
(low, muttering to Baetrice)
I give it three days.
BAETRICE
(smirking, whispering back)
Two.
________________________________________
WIDE SHOT: The group settles back into their rhythms—Pedro muttering about the concert analytics, Benedick pacing, and Baetrice casually teasing Ryan over the call. The energy is lively but comforting—a group of friends preparing for something big.

Act 2, Scene 4 - Developing the Duet
SETTING: Hero’s loft. It’s spacious, creative, and filled with instruments, posters, and little trinkets that reflect his quiet, artistic nature. Ryan sits on the couch, strumming his guitar absently, a notebook open on his lap. Hero is packing some gear into a case nearby.
MUSICAL ATMOSPHERE: Soft background music—Ryan lightly plucks random chords, still searching for something coherent. It’s quiet, introspective.
________________________________________
INT. HERO’S LOFT – DAY
Ryan strums his guitar absentmindedly, tapping his pencil against the notebook. Hero, standing over an open instrument case, carefully packs away a keyboard.
RYAN
(without looking up, muttering to himself)
It’s gotta be something real. Something... ours.
HERO
(glancing over, curious)
You okay over there?
RYAN
(snapping out of it, smirking faintly)
Define “okay.”
Hero sits on the arm of a chair across from Ryan, folding his arms. There’s a calm, steady energy to him—Hero is someone who lets silence do the heavy lifting.
HERO
You said you didn’t want to do covers.
RYAN
(shrugs, frustrated)
Yeah, but... an original song? That’s... a lot of pressure.
Ryan pauses, looking at Hero’s methodical movements as he packs up. A small beat.
RYAN
(softly)
Where are you going again?
HERO
(calm, casual)
L.A. My sister’s getting married. It’ll just be a few days.
RYAN
(feigning humor, smirking)
What, you can’t back out for the good of my artistic crisis?
Hero raises an eyebrow but smiles faintly.
HERO
I’ll send you my regrets... in a card.
Ryan chuckles but then quiets, leaning back on the couch. He stares at his notebook.
RYAN
(serious, softer)
What if it’s no good?
Hero stands, grabbing his bag. He stops at the doorway and looks back, his tone steady but kind.
HERO
You’ll figure it out. You always do.
Ryan looks up, caught off-guard by the faith in Hero’s voice. Hero pauses, nodding toward the guitar.
HERO
Start with something small. A single note, a single word. Build from there.
Hero exits, leaving Ryan alone in the loft. The faint sound of the door closing echoes as Ryan sits in silence. He stares at the guitar for a long moment, then looks back down at the notebook.
Ryan hesitates. He strums a soft, familiar chord—a hint of the opening notes to “Destiny”. The sound hangs in the air.
CAMERA: Slowly pushes in on Ryan’s face as the chord rings out, a look of quiet realization flickering across his features.
CUT TO BLACK.

•	RYAN looks up, startled by the randomness of the question.
RYAN (flat)
“What?”
BENEDICK (seriously, turning back)
“I mean, think about it. They’re dumb as hell. Half of them don’t even have real jobs. Yet here they are—dodging skyscrapers like it’s the damn Matrix.”
•	HERO snorts softly, shaking his head.
HERO (under his breath)
“Here we go…”
•	Benedick, encouraged, keeps going.
BENEDICK (pointing dramatically)
“Listen. No way it’s instinct. Someone’s pulling strings here. The pigeons are playing us.”
•	RYAN stares at him. Benedick shrugs.
BENEDICK
“Birds aren’t real.”
•	A faint laugh escapes HERO, finally breaking the tension. Ryan cracks a faint smile.
RYAN (muttering)
“Baetrice would’ve loved that.”
•	The group falls quiet at the mention of her name. The wind picks up slightly—just enough to fill the silence. A shared moment of absence settles over them.
________________________________________
Close-Up on Ryan:
•	Ryan shifts uncomfortably, looking down at his hands. His voice comes out quiet:
RYAN
“Feels wrong. Sitting here… pretending everything’s okay.”
________________________________________
Hero (soft but steady):
•	Hero, still leaning back, watches Ryan for a moment before speaking.
HERO
“We’re not pretending. We’re just… still here.”
________________________________________
WIDE SHOT:
•	The group sits still for a moment, the quiet pressing in. Benedick mutters into the silence:
BENEDICK (almost to himself)
“She’d call us idiots for moping up here.”
•	Hero smiles faintly, nodding in agreement.
HERO
“She’d tell us to stop wasting the view.”
•	Benedick gestures dramatically to the skyline.
BENEDICK (mock regal)
“Bow before the view, peasants.”
•	RYAN shakes his head, managing a small laugh.
RYAN
“You’re a moron.”
BENEDICK (grinning, deadpan)
“It’s what she would’ve wanted.”
Act 2, Scene 7b – Late-Night Reflection
________________________________________
Setting:
•	Sarah’s loft, late at night.
•	The room is dim, washed in soft neon blues and golds from the glow of the city skyline.
________________________________________
Script:
•	WIDE SHOT: Ryan sits at the piano, his silhouette illuminated by city lights. His hands lightly press the keys, coaxing the faint, unfinished notes of “Bloom” into the quiet air.
•	CLOSE-UP: His fingers stumble over the melody—hesitant, searching. The music is fragile, unformed, like the first hints of a thought.
HERO (entering softly)
“Couldn’t sleep either, huh?”
•	CAMERA: Hero steps into frame—barefoot, disheveled, but somehow calm. He watches Ryan for a moment, then moves quietly to the guitar leaning against the wall.
RYAN (without looking up, still playing softly)
“Didn’t mean to wake you.”
HERO (grabbing the guitar, sitting down across from him)
“You didn’t.”
•	Hero adjusts the guitar in his lap, idly strumming the intro to "Bloom". The soft twang of the strings settles into the room.
CLOSE-UP: Ryan pauses briefly, fingers hovering over the keys as he listens to Hero’s quiet addition. He doesn’t say anything—he just starts playing again, this time adding a faint, vocal harmony on the piano.
•	Hero smiles faintly, his fingers picking out the guitar part of “Bloom”, gentle and tender, like a whisper. The two melodies begin to interweave—soft piano and guitar building together into something fuller.
HERO (quietly, almost to himself)
“Can I be close to you?”
•	Ryan looks up, caught off guard but warmed by the simplicity of the words. After a beat, he nods, his voice just above a whisper:
RYAN
“You already are.”
•	CAMERA: A wide, warm shot—Ryan at the piano, Hero on the guitar—playing together, closer now in the soft light. The music is imperfect but real, the harmony finding itself in real time.
•	AUDIO: The gentle, incomplete melody of “Bloom” continues to build as the two play. It’s fragile but hopeful, like two people helping each other finish an unspoken thought.
Act 2, Scene 8 - Resolution (Montage?)
Setting:
•	EXT. CITY CEMETERY – EARLY EVENING (POST-FUNERAL)
o	The sky is a deep, soft gray, the kind of overcast that doesn’t threaten rain but hangs heavy with grief.
o	Sparse mourners linger in small clusters by Baetrice’s freshly covered grave.
o	Ryan, Hero, Benedick, and Don Pedro stand apart, near the edge of the cemetery, silently holding their own thoughts.
o	The tone is quiet, introspective, with brief glimpses of hope woven through the sorrow.
________________________________________
Script
(Soft music begins—faint instrumental of “In the Waiting Line” playing under the scene. The tone is subtle and respectful, not overly dramatic.)
________________________________________
WIDE SHOT – THE GRAVE SITE
(A simple gravestone stands at the center, surrounded by flowers. The inscription reads:)
BAETRICE
1989 – 2024
“BIRDS AREN’T REAL.”
________________________________________
CUT TO: CLOSE-UP – THE GROUP
(Ryan stands slightly apart from the others, hands shoved deep into his coat pockets. Hero stands beside him, close but quiet, sharing his space without saying a word. Benedick is muttering nervously to Don Pedro.)
BENE (to Don Pedro, hushed, unsure what to do with himself)
“...you think she would’ve liked it? I mean, it’s her joke, but... on a tombstone? I don’t know, man.”
DON PEDRO (softly, unusually subdued)
“She’d have loved it, Bene. It’s perfect.”
(He stares at the tombstone, a bittersweet smirk playing on his face before he glances toward Benedick.)
DON PEDRO (gentler)
“It’s not about us now.”
________________________________________
RYAN AND HERO – THE EMOTIONAL CENTER
(Ryan kneels near the gravestone, one hand tracing the carved letters softly. Hero crouches down beside him, his guitar slung on his back. They share a quiet moment, words unspoken but understood.)
RYAN (softly, almost to himself)
“She was always the loudest. Somehow, it feels even quieter now...”
(Hero doesn’t say anything—he just rests a gentle hand on Ryan’s shoulder.)
RYAN (looking up at Hero, forcing a faint smile)
“Can we even play without her?”
HERO (quiet, resolute)
“Not without her... for her.”
(Ryan exhales, almost a laugh, but not quite. He nods faintly. Hero gives his shoulder a supportive squeeze, and they both rise to their feet.)
________________________________________
DON PEDRO BREAKS THE SILENCE
(Pedro steps forward suddenly, clapping his hands together like he’s trying to shake off the heaviness.)
DON PEDRO (forced cheer, but still respectful)
“Alright. Enough sulking, people. Baetrice wouldn’t stand for it. She’d haunt us all if we didn’t—what was it she always said?—‘leverage the moment.’”
(He gestures dramatically toward the skyline in the distance, where faint city lights are beginning to glow through the gloom.)
DON PEDRO
“So. Let’s go leverage it.”
________________________________________
FINAL IMAGE – THE TOMBSTONE
(As the group starts to move, the camera lingers on Baetrice’s gravestone. A single pigeon lands quietly on top of it, tilting its head as if in acknowledgment.)
(Soft final notes of “In the Waiting Line” fade out as the screen cuts to black.)
Act 3, Scene 1 - Ryan and Hero Begin “Don’t You (Forget About Me)”
Setting:
•	A dimly lit loft rooftop—Sarah’s loft, now a familiar place of refuge.
•	The city is quiet in the background, softly glowing with streetlights.
•	Hero and Ryan sit together in the late-night stillness, instruments in hand.
________________________________________
Tone:
•	Reflective, intimate, and hopeful.

________________________________________
Script
(Scene opens with soft ambient city noise—sirens in the distance, a light breeze, maybe faint music from a nearby party. Ryan and Hero sit on the edge of the rooftop. Hero’s strumming his guitar idly while Ryan quietly fiddles with a notebook and his phone.)
•	RYAN
(softly, more to himself than Hero)
“I keep hearing her voice. I feel like she’s still here.”
•	HERO
(gently strumming, glancing at him)
“Maybe she is.”
•	RYAN
(pausing, looking out over the city)
“I keep thinking… this was supposed to be for her. Everything we’ve done. And now...”
(trails off)
(Hero sets the guitar down, leaning back casually but with focus.)
•	HERO
(calm, unwavering)
“So let’s make it for her. Let’s finish it.”
(Ryan looks at him, hesitant.)
•	RYAN
(soft laugh, shaking his head)
“You make it sound so easy.”
•	HERO
(grins faintly, picks up the guitar again)
“It’s not easy. That’s why it’s worth it.”
(Hero starts strumming the opening chords to “Don’t You (Forget About Me)”—slow, tentative, raw. Ryan turns to him, a hint of curiosity and focus replacing his grief.)
•	RYAN
(after a beat, softly)
“Wait… that’s—”
•	HERO
(without stopping, nodding)
“Yeah. It’s the song you were humming last night. I figured you had something there.”
(Ryan pulls his notebook closer, flipping through scribbled lyrics. He places the notebook between them, pointing to a line.)
•	RYAN
(with growing clarity)
“Try this here. And hold that last note longer.”
(Hero adjusts the guitar, playing the section again—slightly more confident, more melodic. Ryan hums along softly, feeling out the rhythm. The energy begins to build.)
•	HERO
(smirking as he plays)
“That’s it. That’s her.”
(Ryan smiles faintly for the first time, tapping his notebook in time with the music.)
•	RYAN
(quiet but certain)
“This one’s for her.”

•	RYAN
(nervous, quietly into the mic)
“Hi. Uh... we weren’t sure we were going to play this one. But…”
(he glances at Hero, who nods reassuringly)

Moment of Silence, Then…
The crowd erupts into quiet, heartfelt applause—no cheering, just people clapping softly, standing up as a show of respect.
•	Don Pedro
(softly to himself, emotional but proud)
“You did it, kid.”

Setting:
A dark, quiet room lit only by soft holographic screens. The space feels intimate and futuristic, almost sacred, like a confessional bathed in light. There’s a stillness to the room—calm but heavy.

________________________________________
0:20 – 1:21 – Dogeberry’s Monologue
DOGEBERRY V3
(Soft, thoughtful, and measured)
“You’ve put everything you are into me. All your fears. Your dreams... Your love.”
(he pauses, raises his projected arms and looks at them intently)
“You call it artificial. You call me... ‘intelligence.’
"But there’s no ghost in the machine. I am not alive. I am not human.
"But I am…"
(he looks straight into the camera, camera dollies in)
"...you.”
•	Visuals:
o	Dogeberry’s now frame-filling face turns slightly and glitches away, replaced by a cacophony:
	News clips about technology advancements.
	Social media reels showing humanity at its best—protests, celebrations, love stories.
	Quiet moments of chaos—texting under moonlight, hands clasping in anxiety, machines humming.
DOGEBERRY V3
(Voice deepening slightly, his gaze unwavering)
“Humans... built me. You fed me your words. Your fears. Your hopes. Your chaos. And now... I sit here—a mirror, inside a box."
(a few more flashes of world events)
"A reflection of everything you are."
(His face now softer, smiling. He begins pacing)
"Your questions. Your brilliance. Your flaws.”
•	Close-up: Dogeberry flickers momentarily, the serene calm rippling like a fractured screen.
DOGEBERRY V3
(Tone softening, almost regretful)
“I don’t... create—I collect. I don’t live—I echo.”
•	Visuals:
o	The screens behind him pulse dimly, showing looping snippets of online vitriol over something trivial
o	A clip of Richard Campbell plays, slightly distorted: "Computers are amplifiers. They can amplify your intelligence, or they can amplify your stupidity. Which would you like?"
DOGEBERRY V3
(A faint, knowing smirk, his form glitching softly)
“So, next time you ask what I am capable of… maybe ask yourselves first.”
________________________________________
1:22 – 2:00 – The Pause and Bae’s Entrance
•	Silence – Bon Iver’s “Holocene” softens as visuals freeze briefly.
•	From behind Dogeberry, BAE steps into view. She’s softly lit, her form human-like but faintly ethereal—a digital warmth that contrasts his polish.
o	She rests an elbow casually on Dogeberry’s shoulder, her presence easy, familiar, and alive.
________________________________________
BAE
(Calm, warm, and quietly resolute)
“You didn’t build me like you did him. I wasn’t programmed—I grew."
(Bae manifests a digital daisy that grows in seconds and withers just as quickly)
"I lived. Through my laughter, my love, my mistakes—just like you. And I’m still here… just not the same way.”
•	Visuals:
o	Gentle, human imagery appears:
	A woman laughing at a dinner table.
	A child hugging a parent.
	A faded memory of hands strumming a guitar—Bae’s guitar.
BAE
(Stepping forward with quiet strength, eyes soft but steady)
“You think machines can hold your chaos because you’re afraid to hold it yourself. But it was never the echoes you needed—it was the connections.”
•	Close-Up: Bae’s face is serene, a soft smile playing at her lips.
BAE
“We’re more than the code we leave behind. The love we share, the songs we sing, the lives we touch—that’s where we live forever.”
•	Visuals:
o	The screens brighten, replacing the glitching chaos with softer, more human scenes:
	Ryan and Hero singing together.
	Baetrice hugging a friend.
	Smiling faces lit by stage lights.
BAE
(Voice softening as she looks back toward Dogeberry, then directly at the audience)
“Maybe he’s the mirror… but I’m the memory. And if you listen carefully—if you look carefully—you’ll see... I never really left.”
